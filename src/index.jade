        h2 PayPal in Times Square

            img.media-left.left(src='images/times-square-boards-thumb.jpg' width='530')

          p In May 2015, I was comissioned to build an application that would render photos of people in real-time onto 3 skyscraper-sized screens in Times Square. As part of PayPal's "New Money" advertising campaign, photo booths were placed in Times Square where people could get their picture taken and moments later see themselves appear on the screens for thousands to see. I built a Node app that sync'd photos from the photobooth via DropBox, composited them onto an animated currency video using FFMPEG, and simultaneously broadcast a slideshow to multiple endpoints via Web Sockets. 

        p.text-justify.space-below-lg The multi-million dollar project was completed in under 2 months and was successfully released on July 20, 2015 celebrating PayPal's IPO on NASDAQ.

        p RefactorU is a web development bootcamp that trains people in modern web technologies, helping them to become full-stack Javascript developers and acquire the skills to work in the industry as junior developer in just 10 weeks. I developed the original curriculum and served as lead instructor for RefactorU for two years.
